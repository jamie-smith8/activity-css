    <p>Potcakes are truly a remarkable breed of dogs. They make very smart, loyal and loving pets. They generally grow to between 40 and 55lb usually (medium - smaller than labs). They are social pups â€“ very loving to children.
</p>
    
    <h2>What Does Potcake Mean?</h2>
    
    <p>Potcake is the name given to the dogs of the Bahamas and the Turks & Caicos Islands. It came about because the locals fed the caked remains of the cooking pot to the dogs. As generations have passed, Potcakes have evolved into a breed which is extremely smart, loyal and loving. 
</p>

    <p>Potcakes are rescued from around the islands of the Turks & Caicos. Litters of puppies as well as individual pups are found wandering without their littermates. They may be found by tourists while they are out exploring, or locals in their backyard or while working on construction sites. 
</p>

    <p>Potcakes can range between 35lb and 75 lb, but most grow to be approximately 45 lbs, the size of their paws as a puppy gives you a good idea as to how large they will grow.
